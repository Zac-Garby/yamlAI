  === Rules ===
In rule declarations:
  !0-9          -> Saves the word in its place
  x|y           -> Matches either x or y
  *             -> Matches anything recursively
  .             -> Matches anything once

In output strings:
  ?0-9          -> Loads the variable defined in the rule declaration
  %x|y|z%       -> Chooses randomly betweeen 'x', 'y', and 'z'
  :x=0:         -> Sets data field 'x' to variable 0
  ::x=hello::   -> Sets data field 'x' to 'hello'
  @x            -> Loads the data field called 'x'
  {func arg}    -> Runs the function 'func' defined in functions.rb and replaces the call with the result of it
                  - The function is passed the argument, the variables, and the AI's data
  !clr!          -> Clears the screen, by printing "\e[H\e[2J"
